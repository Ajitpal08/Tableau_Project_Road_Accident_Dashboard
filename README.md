# Tableau_Project_Road_Accident_Dashboard
This Tableau dashboard provides an interactive and data-driven analysis of road accidents to identify patterns, trends, and key risk factors. The project aims to help authorities, policymakers, and transportation agencies make informed decisions to improve road safety and reduce accident occurrences.

Key Objectives:
Analyze Accident Trends – Track accident occurrences over time to identify peak accident months, days, and hours.
Identify High-Risk Locations – Use geospatial mapping to pinpoint accident hotspots based on city, highways, or regions.
Understand Contributing Factors – Examine causes such as weather conditions, driver behavior, vehicle type, and road conditions.
Assess Severity Levels – Differentiate between minor, serious, and fatal accidents to prioritize safety measures.
Monitor Accident Demographics – Analyze age, gender, and involvement of pedestrians, drivers, and passengers.
Key KPIs:
Total Number of Accidents
Fatality Rate (%)
Accidents by Vehicle Type (Car, Bike, Truck, etc.)
Accidents by Time of Day (Morning, Afternoon, Night)
Weather Impact on Accidents
Top High-Risk Locations
